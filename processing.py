"""
    Logical processing classes used in the second assignment for CSSE1001/7030.

    ProcessResults: Abstract class that defines the logical processing interface.
    AthleteResults: Provides details of one athleteâ€™s results for all of the
                    events in which they competed.
    CountryResults: Provides a summary of the results of all athletes who
                    competed for one country.
    EventResults  : Provides details of the results of all athlete's who
                    competed in one event.
    DeterminePlaces: Determines the place ranking of all athletes who competed
                     in one event.
